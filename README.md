# Finding-the-best-software-education-market-to-invest

We are asked to examine a new coders survey to decide the best area to create a new content, together with the country of entry. We are going to use 2017 FCC New Coders Survey.

In the end, we are going to make some suggestions for the employer to create an education content for a specific area at a specific country or countries.
